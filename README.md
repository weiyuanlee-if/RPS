# RPS
 Return is an HTML/CSS/Javascript project created to learn basic Javascript and DOM. It was originally made as a C# console project, my first ever coding project. I decided to remake this project as a web app as part of a learning process in web development. I implemented several features such as branching dialogue, keyboard input, and animated CSS.
